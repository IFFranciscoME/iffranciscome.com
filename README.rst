Credit
------

This website was built thanks to the brilliant work of `Brittany Chiang <https://github.com/bchiang7>`_ and the 4th iteration of her `personal website <https://github.com/bchiang7/v4>`_, which she kindly shared with the community in opensource. I wanted to start kind of fresh so I didn't forked but you can check hers and use maybe some mods as included in my version. Naturally, you can take this version also to modify what you want, just give credit to her. 

Modifications
-------------

Some of the modifications I made to Brittany's code are mainly in the aesthetics, i.e. colors, width of main page, logo, extended a section, wide horizontal limit for content, and, of course, my personal content. 

Warning
-------

You are free to fork this repo and to modify it as you like, however, the modifications I made are not optimized for performance, generalization and more important, this is not something you should use in production or mission critical websites.
